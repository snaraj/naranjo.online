// Package testsupport holds the API-level test fixtures and harnesses shared
// by this module's Go suites: the canonical healthy frontend bundle, the
// on-disk media delivery tree, and the Visitor mock-browser harness for
// end-to-end scenarios. Centralizing them keeps every suite exercising the
// same shapes instead of hand-copied near-duplicates that drift apart.
//
// Only fixtures that need public surface area live here. White-box fakes that
// reach unexported internals — the fault-injecting, read-counting embedded
// filesystem in internal/server and the httpRunner lifecycle fake in
// cmd/server — deliberately stay in their own packages, next to the internals
// they observe: this package must never import the packages under test, or
// the in-package suites that consume it could not import it back.
//
// Fixture text is sentinel-only by policy: suites assert markers and
// structure, never real site copy, so shipping real content can never break a
// handler-behavior test.
//
// Everything here is test scaffolding. It runs only inside test binaries and
// is excluded from the enforced coverage denominator by the PR gate.
