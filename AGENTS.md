# Agent contract — naranjo.online

This is the CANONICAL, vendor-agnostic agent contract for this repository:
any frontier model — or hurried human — must be able to operate here cold
from this document alone. Tool-specific entrypoints (CLAUDE.md) only import
it; nothing is duplicated elsewhere. The platform repository's deeper
doctrine applies when the two meet.

## Cold start — first-session checklist

A new agent operates from this repository alone; nothing is relayed by
the owner. In order:

1. Read this file end to end — it is the whole briefing; CLAUDE.md only
   imports it.
2. `git fetch origin` and work from `origin/main`. Never trust a local
   `main`, a stale worktree, or another agent's summary of remote state —
   verify remote facts directly (`gh pr view`, `git ls-remote`).
3. Verify identity and tooling: `gh auth status` shows the owner's
   account; commits carry the noreply identity per "Commit identity
   mechanics"; know CI's pinned toolchain (Go 1.26.5, Node 24.19.0,
   npm 11.17.0 — the gate verifies these exactly).
4. Survey the live state yourself: `gh issue list`, `gh pr list` —
   including the open-agent-PR count against the PR budget below.
5. Claim work through an issue, branch from `origin/main`, and follow
   "Working a change end to end".

## Purpose and architecture

naranjo.online is the owner's personal corner of the internet: a Svelte
frontend embedded into a single dependency-free Go binary (`cmd/server`,
`internal/server`, `internal/web`), shipped as a distroless multi-arch
container plus a Helm chart, and deployed by digest onto a self-hosted
Kubernetes platform. The origin speaks standard HTTP (RFC 9110/9111) only
and is provider-neutral per the deployment-provider contract below. A
fail-closed media subsystem — rooted filesystem capability, reserved
operator namespaces, bounded transfer concurrency — is fully wired but
disabled, awaiting platform deployment and storage discovery. The current
hello-world shell is temporary: the site is becoming a media-rich visual
experience (music, high-quality video, graphics — a music player and
visual blog hybrid), and the test suite is built so that growth is a
conscious edit, never a fight (see Sanctioned evolution).

## Requirements

Numbered for citation, repo-scoped, none negotiable in code:

1. **Zero spend, no external services.** Everything runs on owner hardware
   and free CI. No paid API, SaaS, tracker, CDN, or third-party runtime
   dependency may be introduced — the frontend stays local-origin-only.
2. **Owner-only merges; protected history.** Work lands through PRs into
   `main`; the owner merges. Never push `main`, never force-push, never
   create tags outside the release flow.
3. **Commit-metadata privacy and attribution.** Commits are authored AND
   committed as the owner's GitHub noreply identity (both fields). No
   co-author trailers. Agent-authored commit messages and PR bodies are
   signed `- Fable5` (owner attribution decision, 2026-08-10).
4. **Fail-closed doctrine — never weaken.** No security behavior may be
   made toggleable: no boolean, env var, build tag, or config field may
   silently disable signing, verification, probes, TLS, header policy, or
   fail-closed sentinels. Never weaken a check, guard, validator, or test;
   if one blocks you, fix the cause or surface the conflict. Narrow,
   justified exceptions only, stated where the owner will read them. Tests
   should make dangerous states unrepresentable.
5. **Site independence.** naranjo.online shares conventions with its
   sibling repository (lidersea.com) but depends on nothing from it: no
   shared code, secrets, infrastructure state, or cross-repo references
   in build or runtime.
6. **Provider neutrality (owner requirement R9).** The origin knows no
   ingress, DNS, edge, or access provider. Provider names live exclusively
   in chart values defaults; `TestProviderNeutrality` enforces zero
   occurrences anywhere else. See the deployment-provider contract below.
7. **Ratchet-only coverage floor.** The PR gate enforces
   `GO_COVERAGE_FLOOR` (currently 93.2%, measured 96.2% when last raised).
   Raise it as coverage grows; lowering it weakens an enforced check and is
   out of policy. That measured figure is ONE fact recorded in three places —
   here, the Quality-gates section, and `pr-gate.yml` — so the three move
   together or they become three claims that can disagree.
8. **Truthful serving contract.** Port 8080; `/livez` and `/readyz` stay
   truthful — readiness reflects real serving ability, never a hardcoded
   yes.
9. **Dependency-free Go.** The Go module stays standard-library only.
   Adding a dependency is an owner decision, not a convenience.
10. **Digest deploys, immutable releases.** Images deploy by digest.
    Version tags are immutable and never reassigned. The release workflow
    has no skip flag, no force path, no manual dispatch — never add one.
11. **Media stays out of the control plane.** Heavy media never enters
    git, the bundle, the embed, the image, or a ConfigMap/Secret. Small
    assets respect the documented category and size ceilings. Frontend
    URLs come from `src/lib/media.ts`; components never know hosts,
    volumes, or origins.
12. **No secrets, no personal data.** No credential, token, private host
    fact, or personal data ever enters this repository — including in
    tests, fixtures, and docs.

### Deployment-provider contract

The origin speaks standard HTTP (RFC 9110/9111) only. Ingress, DNS, edge,
and access are injected deployment concerns and never appear in application
code, frontend source, or chart templates. Provider names live exclusively
in the chart's values defaults — `ingress.peerNamespace` and
`ingress.peerAppName` in `chart/values.yaml`, the single binding point the
NetworkPolicy consumes — so a provider swap is a values override, never a
template or code edit. The pin test
(`internal/doctrine/provider_neutrality_test.go`) enforces this, failing
closed on any provider name under `cmd/`, `internal/`, `frontend/src/`, or
`chart/templates/`.

## Testing doctrine (v0.1.8+)

- Coverage is enforced per requirement 7. `internal/testsupport` is test
  scaffolding — it runs only inside test binaries — and is excluded from
  the coverage denominator by the gate's profile filter; that exclusion
  may never grow to cover production packages.
- Lifecycle bounds are proven under `testing/synctest` against
  hand-written fakes (the `httpRunner` seam), so the exact shutdown
  window is exercised in microseconds with no sockets and no sleeps.
- Filesystem boundaries are proven with deep fakes: a read-counting,
  fault-injecting `fs.FS` pins that construction reads everything exactly
  once and the request path never touches the filesystem. The media root
  is deliberately never mocked — it is a security boundary, and its
  faults are staged on a real filesystem.
- End-to-end suites boot `run()` over real TCP and drain on a real
  SIGTERM. Visitor-scenario suites (`cmd/server/visitor_test.go`) drive
  the same boots through the `testsupport.Visitor` mock browser — ETag
  replay, asset following, Range seeking, security baseline on every
  navigation — and must read as user stories.
- Fixture text is sentinel-only: tests assert structure and markers
  (`data-static-fallback`, fixture sentinels), never site copy.
- Repo-doctrine pins live in `internal/doctrine` (currently provider
  neutrality); parity pins guard hand-duplicated lists on both sides
  (Go `TestReservedMediaSegmentsParity` and the frontend media test),
  each failure naming the other file.
- Tests are stdlib-only with hand-written fakes; no assertion libraries,
  no mock frameworks.

## Package layout

- Each Go package keeps its type/struct declarations and package-level
  const/var blocks in `types.go`; methods stay beside the logic they
  serve. A `utils.go` exists only where a genuinely shared cross-file
  utility does — never create an empty or speculative one.
- Shared API-level fixtures and the mock-browser harness live in
  `internal/testsupport`; white-box fakes that need unexported access
  stay in the package they observe (testsupport never imports the
  packages under test). Visitor scenarios live in
  `cmd/server/visitor_test.go`.

## Build, test, and release flows

Build and test, in this order (the same gate CI enforces):

1. `cd frontend && npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund &&
   npm run check && npm test && npm run build` — the build lands in
   `internal/web/dist`, which the Go embed test needs.
2. `gofmt -l .` must be empty; `go vet ./...`;
   `CGO_ENABLED=0 go test ./...`; `go test -race ./...`. CI additionally
   enforces the coverage floor on the scaffolding-filtered profile.
3. `helm lint chart && helm template smoke chart --kube-version v1.36.0`
   for chart changes (the chart requires the platform's Kubernetes
   target; plain `helm template` defaults to older capabilities).
4. `docker build .` when the Dockerfile or build inputs change.

Releases: `VERSION`, `chart/Chart.yaml` (`version` + `appVersion`), the
chart's `image.tag`, and the git tag all move together (CI enforces the
four-way lock). SemVer per the platform's ADR 0014: releases are strict bumps;
history is append-only. Update `CHANGELOG.md` in the same PR as the change it
describes. Pushing `vX.Y.Z` publishes the signed multi-arch image, the signed
OCI chart, and a GitHub Release; deployment RESOLVES digests, never tags. The
rendered reference carries both — `repository:vX.Y.Z@sha256:<hex>` — so a Pod
says which release it is, but only the digest selects bytes, and only the
digest is signed, attested and verified at admission (requirement 10).

## Sanctioned evolution

The following are expected changes, and the suite is built to make them
conscious edits, never fights:

- Adding media MIME types (`mediaTypes` in `internal/server/types.go`)
  together with their rows in `TestMediaMIMETypes`.
- New asset classes under the documented category and size ceilings, and
  real frontend growth: components, routes, and content replacing the
  placeholder shell. Content is not a contract — tests pin structure and
  markers, so shipping real copy must not break a handler test.
- CSP changes happen in lockstep: `securityHeaders` in
  `internal/server/server.go`, `testsupport.SiteContentSecurityPolicy`,
  and every pinned test value move in the same commit.
- Media enablement after the platform deploys: the fail-closed media
  plumbing (reserved namespaces, root validation, concurrency budget) IS
  the future music/video path and stays fail-closed until the reviewed
  root and measured concurrency budget exist. Enabling media is chart
  configuration plus discovery evidence — never code weakening.
- Ingress provider changes: a values override of the `ingress` block per
  the deployment-provider contract.

None of this relaxes the requirements above: security behavior stays
non-toggleable, the reserved-namespace lists stay exact and pinned
against each other on both sides, provider names stay confined to values
defaults, and the coverage floor only rises.

## Adversarial review protocol

Every substantive PR receives an independent adversarial review BEFORE it
leaves draft. The mechanism is vendor-agnostic: any capable agent — or a
human — runs it with git, a shell, and this repository's own gates; no
step assumes a particular AI tool. (Claude sessions load this contract
automatically through CLAUDE.md; other agents read AGENTS.md directly.
Neither gets a different protocol.)

**Reviewer independence.** The reviewer is a different agent or context
than the author — a fresh session of the same vendor qualifies; a
different lane is better. The reviewer works in a disposable worktree at
the PR head, stays read-only toward the author's workspace, reverts every
experiment, and removes the worktree afterward.

**The review must:**

1. Audit every claim in the PR body and commit messages against the
   actual diffs, reproducing every number the body cites. Overstatement
   is a finding even when the code is right.
2. Build a mutation kill matrix: for each guard or test the PR adds or
   changes, apply the exact regression it claims to prevent — the suite
   must go red. Revert between mutations. A surviving mutant is a
   finding.
3. Probe for vacuity: a guard that cannot fail is no guard. For each new
   or changed assertion, demonstrate at least one input that turns it
   red (the kill matrix usually supplies it); an assertion no input can
   fail is decorative, and decorative checks are findings.
4. Probe for flakes: the full suite at least three times, plus the race
   detector where the language has one. Any nondeterminism is a finding
   naming the test.
5. Check hygiene: commit identity (owner noreply in BOTH author and
   committer), signature conventions and agent labels, no co-author
   trailers, secret scan clean, out-of-lane paths untouched.
6. Check doctrine: nothing weakened — every gate, validator, or test
   change is additive or strengthening; exceptions are narrow, named,
   and justified where the owner will read them.
7. For CI-invisible paths (jobs that run only on pushes to main), demand
   simulated evidence of both directions in the PR and treat the first
   post-merge run as part of the change under review.

**Verdict format** — posted as a PR comment, so every vendor and the
owner see the identical record: APPROVE or REQUEST-CHANGES; numbered
findings with severity and file:line; the mutation kill matrix; flake
results; a claim-audit table (SUPPORTED / OVERSTATED per claim); explicit
"no finding — checked X, Y, Z" statements so silence is never ambiguous;
confirmation the scratch workspace was removed; the reviewing agent's
signature in the form `- <Agent> (adversarial reviewer)`, matching its
agent label. Posting the verdict also removes the `requires-review`
label, whichever way the verdict went — the item is no longer waiting on
review attention. A REQUEST-CHANGES verdict returns the work to the same
branch owner — fixes land on the same branch and receive a delta
re-review of the changed scope. A PR flips from draft to ready only
after an APPROVE verdict (or after findings are fixed and re-verified),
and the evidence comment remains on the PR as the permanent record.

A green check, a peer approval, or a ready state is evidence, never
authority: the owner alone merges.

## GitHub conventions

- **Issues first.** Substantive work is tracked as a labeled issue before or
  alongside its PR; PRs declare `Closes #N` so merges close the record.
  Feature intake lands as a `features`-labeled issue with the architectural
  constraints stated, even when implementation waits.
- **Labels.** One taxonomy, identical names/colors/meanings across all
  three repositories: `production-readiness`, `conventions`, `security`,
  `tests`, `ci`, `docs`, `release`, `fix`, `provider-neutrality`,
  `delivery-lane`, `features`, `requires-review`. New labels are added to
  all three at once.
- **`requires-review` — the review-readiness signal.** The author lane
  applies `requires-review` the moment a PR or issue is
  complete-from-author — every commit pushed, body and evidence final —
  so review attention is productive. Its ABSENCE on an open
  agent-authored PR or issue means the item is still in flight:
  reviewers and other lanes must not spend review effort on it. The
  reviewer removes it when posting the verdict; on REQUEST-CHANGES the
  author re-applies it once the fix commits are pushed. On an issue it
  carries the same meaning — complete enough to act on or decide — and
  whoever then acts on it or records the decision removes the label;
  opening a PR that claims the issue counts as acting. It is
  a coordination signal only: never a substitute for draft/ready state,
  for the APPROVE verdict that flips a PR ready, or for owner merge
  authority.
- **Agent labels.** Every agent-created PR and issue carries TWO further
  labels: the umbrella `agent-authored` AND the acting agent's own label —
  `fable5` (Claude Fable 5), `5.6-sol` (ChatGPT 5.6 SOL ULTRA), `opus5`
  (Claude Opus 5), `opus4.8` (Claude Opus 4.8). The body signature must
  match the label (`- Fable5` ↔ `fable5`), and adversarial-review
  verdicts carry the same identity as `- <Agent> (adversarial reviewer)`.
  These repositories are worked by several frontier models in parallel
  lanes; labels plus signatures keep authorship auditable with no owner
  relay. When a new model joins, its label — description "Authored by
  <model>" — is created in ALL THREE repositories before its first PR,
  per the one-taxonomy rule.
- **PR budget.** At most 3 agent PRs open in this repository by default;
  parallel pushes beyond that need explicit owner authorization first.
- **Merge authority.** THE OWNER ALONE MERGES. Never merge, never
  self-approve, never treat a peer approval or a green check as
  authority, and never force-push a shared ref. Every PR opens as a
  draft.
- **Milestones.** Every PR and issue carries one. Release milestones close
  when the release ships; completed arcs close their milestone.
- **Assignee.** The owner is assignee on every PR and issue (authorship is
  already the owner's account by token identity).
- **Linear history.** Merge commits are disabled in repository settings;
  the owner merges by squash (or rebase). Branches auto-delete on merge;
  stale local branches are pruned as work lands. History is append-only
  and never rewritten.
- **Commits.** Detailed bodies to the review protocol's evidence standard —
  problem, mechanism, enumerated changes, evidence — signed per lane.

## Working a change end to end

The complete delivery loop, each step gated by the sections around it:

1. **Claim the work.** File (or take) the issue; state intent and
   constraints. Label it — including both agent labels — assign the
   owner, set a milestone. Apply `requires-review` once the issue is
   complete-from-author — the problem stated, the acceptance criteria
   final; until it carries that label, the issue is still being drafted.
2. **Branch from `origin/main`** after `git fetch origin`; branch names
   are lane-prefixed (`fable5/<topic>`). One writer per branch, always —
   a branch that is not yours is a branch you never push to.
3. **Build the change** inside the requirements and doctrine above.
   Docs-only diffs still run the gates.
4. **Run the full local gate** ("Quality gates" below), then both secret
   scans, then commit under the pinned identity with a body to the
   evidence standard, ending with your signature.
5. **Push and open a DRAFT PR**: `Closes #N`, the same labels, owner as
   assignee, a milestone, body signed. Every number in the body must be
   reproducible — the adversarial review will reproduce it. Apply
   `requires-review` once the PR is complete-from-author — every commit
   pushed, the body final; until it carries that label, nobody reviews
   it.
6. **Adversarial review** per the protocol above; findings are fixed on
   the same branch by the same writer and delta re-reviewed before the
   flip to ready.
7. **Owner comments** are handled per the owner review protocol below.
8. **The owner merges.** Nothing you can do — approval, green checks,
   ready state — substitutes for that.

## Commit identity mechanics

Requirement 3, made operational. The identity — BOTH author and
committer, on every outgoing commit — is exactly:

    Samuel Naranjo <39077795+snaraj@users.noreply.github.com>

- Pin it per command with environment variables, never with `git config`
  (repository or global): configuration outlives the session, leaks into
  unrelated work, and hides identity decisions from review.

      GIT_AUTHOR_NAME='Samuel Naranjo' \
      GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL='39077795+snaraj@users.noreply.github.com' \
      GIT_COMMITTER_NAME='Samuel Naranjo' \
      GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL='39077795+snaraj@users.noreply.github.com' \
      git commit ...

- EVERY history-writing command runs under the same pinned environment —
  `commit`, `commit --amend`, `rebase`, `cherry-pick`. A rebase rewrites
  the COMMITTER of every replayed commit, and the privacy gate checks
  the committer field, so an unpinned rebase silently reintroduces the
  machine identity into otherwise-clean commits.
- No `Co-Authored-By` trailers, ever. Agent-authored commit bodies, PR
  bodies, and issue bodies end with the acting agent's signature (this
  lane: `- Fable5`), matching its agent label.
- Treat the Git index as public (requirement 12): no hostname, IP
  address, machine or account identifier, username, workspace path,
  token, or private operational fact enters any commit, message,
  fixture, or doc — what reaches history cannot be unpublished.

## Owner review protocol

Comments the owner leaves on PRs ARE code reviews — address each
promptly, reply IN-THREAD per comment describing the resolution, then
notify the owner the PR is ready to re-check; never mark a PR ready
with unaddressed owner comments.

## Stacked pull requests

Stacking is sanctioned for dependent work; these rules exist because a
squash-merge repository punishes careless stacks:

- The stacked PR's base is THE BRANCH IT STACKS ON, so its diff shows
  only the increment.
- A stacked PR STAYS DRAFT UNTIL ITS BASE MERGES. Squashing a stacked
  PR before its base would duplicate the base's entire content into
  `main`.
- When the base merges: `git fetch --prune`; rebase the stacked branch
  onto `main` under the pinned identity environment (the committer
  rewrite above); re-run the full gate on the rebased head; then
  `git push --force-with-lease` to YOUR OWN single-writer branch — the
  sole force-push an agent ever performs (CI's force-update of the
  generated `badges` branch is machinery's own documented exception).
  GitHub retargets the PR to `main` automatically; verify the retarget
  and the residual diff yourself.
- One writer per branch, always, and remote truth is checked directly —
  `gh pr view`, `git ls-remote` — never assumed from another agent's
  report.

## Quality gates — exact commands and patterns

The full local gate, in order, before every push — docs-only diffs
included; it is the same battery CI enforces:

    cd frontend && npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund && \
      npm run check && npm test && npm run build && cd ..
    test -z "$(gofmt -l .)"
    go vet ./...
    CGO_ENABLED=0 go test ./...
    go test -race ./...
    helm lint chart && helm template smoke chart \
      --kube-version v1.36.0                    # chart changes
    docker build .                              # Dockerfile/build-input changes
    gitleaks git --no-banner --redact --max-target-megabytes=2 .
    gitleaks dir --no-banner --redact .

- **Coverage floor.** `GO_COVERAGE_FLOOR` is 93.2 (measured 96.2 when
  last raised), enforced in `.github/workflows/pr-gate.yml` on total
  production statements with `internal/testsupport` filtered from the
  profile — the ONLY exclusion, and it may never grow to cover
  production packages. Ratchet only (requirement 7).
- **Perf budgets are tests.** Payload caps ship as pinned suite
  assertions, so a budget regression is a red build, never a
  discussion: the panels API pins `MaxIndexResponseBytes` = 4096 and
  `MaxPanelResponseBytes` = 32768
  (`TestResponsesStayWithinTheOwnerBudgets`,
  `internal/panels/handler_test.go`), and construction/refresh refuse
  over-budget payloads instead of serving them. Every new surface lands
  with its caps pinned the same way.
- **Ratchet pairs.** When a stated requirement and shipped behavior
  disagree across lanes, record the gap loudly instead of greenwashing
  it: one green test pins current behavior, and a paired
  expected-failure test asserts the pending contract, flipping the
  suite red the day the implementation tightens — which forces the
  marker's removal and turns the note into an enforced rule. The
  canonical exemplar lives in the platform repository
  (`tests/security/test_containerd_cri_health_contract_matrix.py`); Go
  suites here express the same pair as a behavior pin plus a named
  pending-contract test documented in its comment.
- **Secret scan, both modes.** `gitleaks git` (full history) AND
  `gitleaks dir` (working tree) run before every push — the same scans
  CI runs. Exceptions live only in `.gitleaksignore` as commit-scoped
  fingerprints (`commit:file:rule:line`) with an in-file justification,
  admitted only for verified false positives already in pushed history;
  the working tree must always scan clean WITHOUT them.
- **Flake probe.** Before a PR leaves draft the full suite has run at
  least three times (author and reviewer independently); any
  nondeterminism is a finding naming the test.

## CI map

- **pr-gate.yml** — pull requests AND pushes to `main` (plus manual
  dispatch): `security` (checksum-verified tool install, actionlint,
  `gitleaks git` over full history, `gitleaks dir`),
  `dependency-review` (PRs only; fails on high severity), `application`
  (toolchain pinned AND verified — Node 24.19.0, npm 11.17.0,
  Go 1.26.5; frontend check/test/build; gofmt/vet/tests/race; the
  coverage floor), `chart` (helm lint + render at
  `--kube-version v1.36.0`; the VERSION ↔ chart `version` ↔
  `appVersion` ↔ chart `image.tag` four-way lock, plus a render
  assertion that the emitted reference still carries a full digest),
  `container` (both production
  architectures built, never published).
- **coverage-badges** — `main` pushes only: recomputes both coverages
  with the gate's own recipe and force-updates the generated
  single-commit `badges` branch. Badge numbers are CI-computed, never
  hand-edited; the badge publishes the identical number the gate
  enforced.
- **codeql.yml** — pull requests, `main` pushes, weekly cron.
- **release-publisher.yml** — version tags only; no manual dispatch, no
  skip flag, no force path (requirement 10).
- **Zero-spend guardrails.** Workflows declare top-level
  `permissions: {}` with narrow per-job read grants;
  `persist-credentials: false` on every checkout; GitHub-hosted
  `ubuntu-24.04` runners only; every action pinned to a full commit SHA
  with a version comment; third-party tools installed only through the
  checksum-verifying `scripts/ci/install-tools.sh`. No external service
  ever receives repository content or measurements — the self-hosted
  badge pipeline exists precisely so no coverage processor does.

## Frontend and UX floors

Owner directives (2026-08-11) for both site repositories; each
implements them independently — patterns may rhyme, but code, values,
and tests re-derive per repository (requirement 5):

- **Design tokens only.** `styles.css` is a CSS custom-property token
  layer: the light palette on `:root`, every further reading mode one
  `[data-theme]` override block, `prefers-color-scheme` mapping the
  dark tokens absent an explicit choice. Components consume tokens —
  never raw palette literals.
- **Dataviz floors.** A value is never encoded by color alone: pair
  color with position, text, or shape, and use palettes validated for
  contrast under every reading mode.
- **Rendering lanes, stage 1** (issue #26; static cross-browser floors
  pinned by frontend tests — iPhone/Android plus
  Safari/Chrome/Firefox/Edge): viewport meta with safe-area-inset
  padding; touch targets ≥ 44px; input font-size ≥ 16px; `svh`/`dvh`,
  never `100vh`; `@supports` fallbacks so rails and grids degrade
  gracefully; no horizontal body scroll at ≥ 320px (wide content
  scrolls inside its own container); `prefers-reduced-motion`
  respected; autoplaying video is `playsinline` and muted. Stage 2 —
  browser-emulated smoke lanes in CI — is an owner decision, gated in
  that issue.
- **Zero CLS.** Theme switches and async data arrivals cause no layout
  shift; space for late content is reserved up front.
- **Honest states.** Empty, loading, disabled, and unavailable states
  tell the truth: a missing backend renders an explicit unavailable
  state, never fabricated data or a pretend success path — the panels'
  provenance-truthful `status` field is the model.

## Security invariants beyond the numbered requirements

Structural promises of the panels subsystem, pinned by
`internal/panels`'s doctrine test:

- **Confined egress.** `internal/panels/fetch.go` is the ONLY
  egress-capable production file — HTTP client construction, request
  building, URL handling, and environment reads may exist nowhere
  else — and every other production file keeps a reviewed zero-egress
  import surface. Outbound requests are refused unless the host is on
  the configured allowlist (checked at construction AND again at
  request time), bounded by timeout and byte cap; credentials are read
  from the environment at fetch time only, flow straight into a request
  header, and are never stored, logged, or served.
- **Envelope versioning.** Every panel response is the `panel/v1`
  envelope `{schema, id, kind, title, generatedAt, status, data}` —
  stable forever by design. Evolution happens inside the kind-versioned
  payloads: a breaking payload change mints a NEW kind version, never
  mutates an existing one, never bends the outer shape.
- **Live refresh is opt-in, and enabling it is an operational decision.**
  `PANELS_REFRESH` gates every background refresh loop; unset or `false`
  launches no loop at all, so egress is impossible rather than merely
  unattempted, and any other value fails the boot. Enabling it in a cluster
  needs three things together — `PANELS_REFRESH=true`, the credential
  variables named by `keyEnvName` in `internal/panels/config/fetch.json`
  supplied as Secrets, and an egress allowance for that file's `hosts`
  list — and that enablement is a SEPARATE owner-reviewed step (standing
  audit item S2). No key, and no reference to a key, ever lands here
  (requirement 12); a source whose variable is unset is skipped, never
  faked. README's "Enabling live refresh" section is the operator-facing
  copy of this, and both must move together.
- **Panels tell the truth about where a number came from.** The envelope's
  `status` carries provenance for the whole payload, and inside
  `token-usage/v1` each stat tile and insight carries `recorded` for its
  own. A figure captured out of band says so rather than borrowing the
  panel's freshness, an unreported figure serves `null` and renders as a
  dash rather than a zero, and an invented figure is a doctrine violation
  no matter how good the panel looks with it.
- **Vendor names are data, never code.** Tool and vendor names appear
  only as data labels inside snapshots and the embedded fetch config
  (see `vendorMarks` in `internal/panels/doctrine_test.go`); the pin
  scans production source bytes — identifiers, strings, and comments
  alike — so a provider swap is a data edit and the compiled binary
  carries no vendor coupling.

## Docs and attribution conventions

- **CHANGELOG discipline.** Keep a Changelog format; SemVer matching
  image/chart tags exactly; the entry lands under `[Unreleased]` in the
  SAME PR as the change it describes, and the release PR moves it under
  the version heading.
- **Truthful README.** Badges and claims report only what CI actually
  measured or the repository can demonstrate — the coverage badges
  publish the gate's own numbers, and prose never advertises a
  capability or deployment state that does not exist yet.
- **Attribution for third-party assets.** Every third-party asset lands
  with its reviewed license (`frontend/src/assets/fonts/` carries
  webfont licenses). Where Jagex game art or intellectual property is
  used — the OSRS boss-log panel — the exact Fan Content Policy notice
  accompanies it, word for word, pinned by a frontend test wherever it
  renders:

      Created using intellectual property belonging to Jagex Limited
      under the terms of Jagex's Fan Content Policy. This content is
      not endorsed by or affiliated with Jagex.
