"""The site's compliance manifest, validated, and the live site judged by it.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The origin keeps strong privacy properties by construction --
`default-src 'self'`, no cookie of its own, no client address in its logs --
and every one of them is pinned by a Go test against the binary. None of those
tests can see what a visitor actually receives, because an edge sits between
the binary and the visitor and can add headers, scripts and reporting
endpoints of its own. On 2026-10-08 it was doing all three (issue #355). And
nothing kept the facts a privacy notice must state -- what the site stores on
a visitor's device, which third parties a page contacts, which legal pages
exist -- written down in one place a gate could hold the site to.

`compliance.json` at the repository root is that place. This file has two
subcommands, and the browser lanes (`frontend/e2e/compliance.spec.mjs`) read
the same manifest:

  check  validate the manifest's closed schema, and hold its storage list to
         the source in both directions: a declared cookie or storage key that
         no frontend file WRITES as that kind is stale, and a write the
         manifest does not declare is refused (`storage_writes` states the
         write grammar). A data-collection entry whose evidence file is gone
         is stale too.
  live   GET the production URL and judge what the edge actually serves: the
         answer must be complete (never a prefix past the byte cap, never
         short of its Content-Length), the CSP must admit no origin the
         manifest does not declare (and none at all through a wildcard or a
         bare scheme), script directives must not admit 'unsafe-inline' or
         eval'd code, a declared injected script passes only while a policy
         blocks every inline script, framing must be denied, HSTS must last a
         year, nosniff and a Referrer-Policy must be present, the document must
         set no cookie, every reporting endpoint and every script, stylesheet
         or embedded resource in the served HTML must be this origin's or
         declared, and every published legal page must answer 200. A declared
         third party or edge observation that no longer occurs is refused as
         stale, so an exemption never outlives its case.

PIN BEHAVIOUR, NOT INVENTORY. Nothing here asserts "the site has exactly these
headers" or "these are all the scripts". Each rule refuses one construct that
changes what a visitor is exposed to, and a legitimate addition either passes
untouched or needs one declared line.

LIFT. A refusal a manifest line can admit prints that exact line, and every
entry needs a written reason (and, for an edge observation, the issue that
holds the decision). Adding a declared third party is a normal, reviewed
one-line change; it is also exactly the line a privacy notice has to mention,
which is the point. The rest print no line because none exists: a missing CSP,
allowed framing, short HSTS, a missing header, a cookie on the document, a
write on load, an injected script the CSP can let run, or an incomplete answer
needs a code, policy or owner decision, never a declaration.

Logging follows the repository's failure-visibility rule: one START line with
the budget, one line per refusal, one SUMMARY with the decision and duration.
