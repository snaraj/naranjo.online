"""Every `release_contract.py` subcommand must have a caller, and the sweep
that proves it must survive line wrapping.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `scripts/ci/release_contract.py` registers its subcommands
with `argparse`, and the workflows invoke them by NAME, as strings, in shell.
Nothing checked that the two sides agree, in either direction. That asymmetry
produced a near-miss during the 0.1.49 dead-code lane: an audit reported
`release-record` as dead and proposed removing it. It is not dead -- it is
invoked from the terminal publisher step of `release-publisher.yml` and again
from `release-audit.yml`. The audit missed it because the invocation is
wrapped with a trailing backslash, so any same-line pattern that includes an
ARGUMENT (`release-record --release-json`) matches nothing:

    python3 -I -B scripts/ci/release_contract.py release-record \\
      --release-json "${release_json}" --tag "${TAG}" \\
      ...

Removing it was proven to break the publisher at runtime. A gate that only
looks at one side of a string-typed interface is how that gets shipped.

WHAT IT PINS -- BEHAVIOUR, NOT INVENTORY. This gate does NOT assert "the
complete set of subcommands is exactly these 27". Such a pin would break on
every legitimate subcommand addition and would teach the next agent to update
a number rather than think. It asserts one behaviour instead: no registered
subcommand may be unreachable from the repository that ships it. The names
come from the PARSER OBJECT at runtime, so adding or renaming a subcommand
needs no edit here; only a subcommand with genuinely no caller does.

HOW THE SWEEP WORKS.

  * Names are read from the live `argparse` parser (`_parser()`), never from a
    hand-maintained list, so this file cannot drift from the CLI it guards.

  * Each name is searched as a BARE TOKEN -- `(?<![0-9A-Za-z_-])name
    (?![0-9A-Za-z_-])` -- anywhere in a file, with no requirement that it share
    a line with `release_contract.py`. That is the specific defence against the
    near-miss above: a backslash wrap cannot hide a caller from a search that
    never looks at line structure.

  * Comments are stripped first, per file type, because a comment is not a
    caller. `immutable-settings` appears in `release-after-main.yml` only in
    the prose sentence "the publisher's authoritative immutable-settings
    guard"; counting that as a workflow caller would hide a real smell behind
    a sentence. Markdown is the deliberate exception -- prose in `docs/` IS
    the caller for an operator escape hatch -- so only `<!-- -->` is removed
    there.

  * The defining file, `release_contract.py` itself, is excluded. Its
    `add_parser("x")` registrations and `args.command == "x"` dispatch arms are
    self-references, and counting them would make every subcommand look alive.

TIERS, AND WHY THEY DIFFER. A caller is reported as `workflow`, `script`,
`doc`, or `test`, because the tiers do not mean the same thing. A doc-only
subcommand is legitimate: `settings-receipt` and `settings-preflight` are
operator escape hatches invoked by hand from `docs/release-governance.md`, and
a human running a documented command is a real caller. A TEST-only subcommand
is a genuine smell -- the CLI surface exists solely to be tested, so the test
proves only that the test can call it. This gate therefore fails on zero
callers of any tier, and separately on test-only.

HONEST LIMIT. Bare-token matching over-counts rather than under-counts: a name
that is also an ordinary English word (`publisher`, `transition`) matches
prose. Over-counting can only produce a false GREEN -- never a false RED --
so the failure direction stays safe, but this gate is a floor on reachability,
not a proof of use. Under-counting was the bug it was built for, and that
direction is closed.

LIFTING IT. Both refusals lift through
`scripts/ci/subcommand-callers-allowlist.txt`: one line, one written reason,
one PR. Widening it is an expected part of active development. The gate
refuses a stale entry, so the file ratchets shut as callers land.

        This one looks reachable and is not. Exactly one subcommand is test-only
        today -- `immutable-settings` -- and it is ALLOWLISTED, so the rule
        short-circuits on `name in self.allowlist` before its `self.fail` and
        the refusal could be deleted with the suite staying green. Dropping the
        allowlist entry does turn the suite red, which proves the rule correct
        but says nothing about whether the rule still exists.

        That is the same surviving-mutant class as the zero-caller rule above,
        one allowlist entry further along, and it was found while re-running the
        matrix for the 0.1.49 review's finding 2 rather than by that review.
