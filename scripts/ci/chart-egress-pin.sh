# chart-egress-pin — prove the rendered application NetworkPolicy denies ALL
# outbound traffic: it declares the Egress policy type AND an exactly empty
# egress rule list, over a pod selector that names this workload.
#
# Why both halves are load-bearing. `egress: []` alone is inert: Kubernetes
# applies egress rules only to policies that list `Egress` in `policyTypes`,
# so a policy carrying an empty egress list WITHOUT that type restricts
# nothing and the Pod keeps unrestricted outbound connectivity. Conversely
# `policyTypes: [Egress]` with any rule present is an allowance, and the
# emptiest-looking rule — `- {}` — is the widest one there is. And both
# halves only bind the Pods the policy selects, so a selector that names the
# wrong app or drops the instance leaves the workload with full egress while
# the manifest still reads "default deny".
#
# HOW THIS GATE READS THE RENDER. Like its ingress sibling it does not grep
# for a token: it extracts each `spec` child sub-tree by indentation and
# compares the WHOLE sub-tree against a pinned literal, so any extra rule,
# extra peer, added port, DNS exception, duplicate key, or flow-style
# rewrite fails — in block or flow style. The parser is stdlib Python (these
# repos are stdlib-only): no PyYAML, no yq, so it runs anywhere helm does.
#
# AND WHY THAT IS NOT ENOUGH ON ITS OWN (issue #86). The text pin below reads
# ONE template's render by raw line: a document is recognised by a line whose
# prefix is exactly `kind`, and the spec by a line exactly equal to `spec:`.
# YAML allows whitespace before a key's colon, allows the key to be quoted,
# and resolves escapes inside a double-quoted key — so a SECOND NetworkPolicy
# spelled `kind :` / `spec :`, in this same file, was invisible to that
# census and to all 19 mutations while parsing, under a real YAML
# implementation, as an empty-selector `policyTypes: [Egress]` policy with
# one empty egress rule. NetworkPolicy allowances are ADDITIVE: that second
# document hands every Pod unrestricted outbound access. The independent
# security review of PR #80 reproduced exactly that at the merged head.
# Assertions (c), (d) and (g) are the answer: a whole-render census through a real
# document reader that normalises keys to their canonical spelling BEFORE
# matching, flattens list wrappers, and requires exactly one NetworkPolicy in
# the complete installable render, equal to an expectation stated in the
# gate. It lives in scripts/ci/chart_render_census.py — too big to embed
# here, and it is unit-tested in scripts/ci/test_chart_render_census.py.
#
# WHERE THE EXPECTATIONS COME FROM. The ingress sibling reads the peer
# identity out of chart/values.yaml because that peer is configuration. This
# policy has no configuration: "no outbound connection, ever" is a constant,
# so it is written here as a constant and NOT read back out of the template
# under test — an expectation derived from the template would pass for any
# template. The selector's two facts come from chart/Chart.yaml (the chart
# name) and this script (the release name and namespace it renders with).
#
# Seven assertions, all failing closed:
#   a. the DEFAULT render — no flags, shipped values — carries the pinned
#      selector, exactly [Ingress, Egress] policy types, and exactly
#      `egress: []`, each compared in full;
#   b. every hostile mutation below is REFUSED. Each is applied to the real
#      render and fed back through assertion (a)'s own checker, which must
#      exit non-zero. A gate that cannot fail is not a gate, and a mutation
#      that survives is a hole this file would otherwise hide;
#   c. the COMPLETE installable render — every template, CRDs included —
#      parses, carries the pinned document inventory, and holds exactly one
#      NetworkPolicy equal to the pinned object, semantics compared, not
#      lines;
#   d. every hostile whole-render mutation is REFUSED by (c) — including the
#      shadow policies that defeated the text pin;
#   e. no values override re-opens egress — the deny is unconditional, not a
#      default (requirement 4: security behavior is never toggleable) — and
#      no override adds a second policy anywhere in the render either;
#   f. the text mutation battery has not been quietly shrunk;
#   g. the census battery has not been quietly shrunk either.
#
# Assertion (c) does compare the ingress rule, because a census that ignores
# half the spec cannot claim the object it found is the pinned one; it takes
# the peer identity from chart/values.yaml, the binding point, so this file
# still names no provider. chart-ingress-pin.sh keeps sole ownership of the
# ingress sub-tree's byte-for-byte canonical TEXT.
