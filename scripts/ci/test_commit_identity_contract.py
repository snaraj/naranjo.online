"""Hostile suite for `commit_identity_contract.py`.

Two halves, and both are load-bearing:

  * PURE rules over hand-built `Commit` records, so every refusal and every
    admission is stated as one readable case.
  * REAL git repositories, built in a temp directory and committed with a pinned
    per-command identity, so the plumbing this gate depends on -- the record-
    separated `git log` format, multi-line bodies, an empty range -- is proven
    against the actual tool rather than a fixture that agrees with itself.

The second half exists because the first cannot fail for the reason that would
actually hurt: a `--format` string that silently stops emitting a field, or a
body containing a blank line, breaks the READER, and a reader that returns
nothing makes every rule above it vacuous. `parse_log` therefore fails closed on
a record it cannot resolve, and that refusal is tested here.
