# chart-ingress-pin — prove the rendered ingress NetworkPolicy admits EXACTLY
# ONE peer, named by every fact it takes to name one connector: peer namespace
# + peer app name + peer instance.
#
# Why the instance is load-bearing: the peer namespace is shared. It holds
# several per-site connectors that publish the SAME app.kubernetes.io/name and
# are separated only by app.kubernetes.io/instance. A selector on namespace and
# app name alone admits every one of them — a policy that reads narrow and
# behaves wide. The deployed policy has always carried the instance pin; this
# gate exists so no render can ship a policy weaker than that.
#
# HOW THIS GATE READS THE RENDER — the security-critical part. It does NOT
# count `- from:` lines with grep and inspect the first: that is bypassable. A
# second ingress rule with no `from` — an empty rule (`- {}`), a flow-style
# rule, or a ports-only rule — renders an allow-all while a `from`-line count
# stays at one, and reading only the first rule never sees it. Instead this
# gate extracts the WHOLE rendered `spec.ingress` sub-tree by indentation and
# asserts, structurally:
#   1. the value is a block sequence of EXACTLY ONE rule item, and
#   2. that sub-tree equals, in full, the one rule built from the values —
# so ANY extra rule, extra peer, dropped selector, or altered field, in block
# or flow style, fails the gate. The parser is stdlib Python (these repos are
# stdlib-only): no PyYAML, no yq, so it runs anywhere helm does.
#
# Three assertions, all failing closed:
#   a. the DEFAULT render — no flags, shipped values — is exactly one rule
#      pinning namespace + app name + instance, compared in full;
#   b. a blank instance and an absent instance are BOTH refused by schema
#      validation, and refused by name, so nothing can render unpinned;
#   c. a different instance moves the pin: the render is again exactly one
#      rule, now carrying the overridden instance and none of the default,
#      with app name and namespace unchanged — which is why app name alone
#      cannot tell two connectors apart.
#
# Expectations come from chart/values.yaml, the provider binding point, so the
# peer identity is stated in exactly one place and this file names no provider.
