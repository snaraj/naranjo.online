"""Narrow refusals in `.github/workflows/` -- and deliberately no step
inventory.

WHAT THIS REFUSES. Each of the first three rules names ONE construct that
silently changes what a gate means, rather than one that merely changes what a
gate does; the fourth refuses a workflow and the contract describing it
disagreeing about the same number:

  1. `continue-on-error: true` on a job or step in the required-checks set.
     It converts a red gate into a green one with no other visible change. The
     release publisher authorizes against `pr-gate.yml`'s exact job inventory
     and CodeQL's exact run/job inventory, and both read a CONCLUSION. A job
     that fails but is told to continue still reports `success`, so this one
     key is the difference between "the gate passed" and "the gate ran".

  2. An `env:` key that SHADOWS an outer declaration of the same key, or that
     redeclares a tool pin `install-tools.sh` owns -- at EVERY scope a step's
     environment comes from, not only the innermost. Scope precedence means the
     inner declaration wins silently, so a step can run against a different
     value than the one every reader sees declared above it -- while the outer
     declaration still reads correct. `GO_COVERAGE_FLOOR` and `SOURCE_SHA` are
     the sharp cases: a shadowed floor passes any coverage, and a shadowed
     source SHA lets a step act on a commit other than the authorized one.

  3. A custom `shell:` on a step in the required-checks set, or a
     `defaults.run.shell` at job or workflow level, which is the same construct
     written where no step carries it and reshells EVERY `run:` step beneath
     it. The runner default for `run:` on Linux is `bash -e {0}`, and this
     repository's convention is to open every `run: |` block with
     `set -euo pipefail`. A custom shell changes failure semantics underneath
     that convention -- `shell: sh` drops `pipefail` support entirely, so a
     failing command mid-pipeline stops being a failing step.

  4. A `GO_COVERAGE_FLOOR` the contract states differently from the value a
     workflow enforces (issue #225). Requirement 7 calls the floor "ONE fact
     recorded in three places" and nothing read both files, so the two could
     drift silently and in either direction: raise the gate alone and AGENTS.md
     understates what CI permits; lower it alone and AGENTS.md promises a
     guarantee CI no longer makes. The number is found by SEARCH on both sides
     -- every `env:` scope of every workflow, and every AGENTS.md paragraph
     naming the variable next to a number -- so a new legitimate sentence
     widens what is read rather than failing for being new.

EVERY SCOPE, NOT THE FIRST ONE SOMEBODY THOUGHT OF. Three of the four review
rounds on this file found the same defect in a different rule: the rule's own
construct written at a SCOPE the rule does not read, passing at `actionlint`
rc=0 on a real workflow. Round 3 found it for rule 3 (`defaults.run.shell` at
job and workflow level, where no step carries it); round 4 found it for rule 2
(a job- or workflow-level `env:`, where no step carries it). So the scope set
of each rule is written down here, audited against GitHub's workflow syntax
rather than against what this repository happens to write, and each rule reads
ALL of its own:

  rule 1  `jobs.<id>.continue-on-error` and `jobs.<id>.steps[*].continue-on-
          error`. Those are the only two positions the key exists in; there is
          no `defaults.continue-on-error` and no workflow-level one.
  rule 2  four positions supply a step's environment, outermost first:
          `jobs.<id>.container.env` (a job container's own environment, which
          every `run:` step in the job inherits), the workflow-level `env:`,
          `jobs.<id>.env`, and `jobs.<id>.steps[*].env`. NOT in the set, and
          deliberately: `jobs.<id>.services.<id>.env` sets the environment of a
          SERVICE container, which is a different container from the one steps
          run in, so no step ever reads it.
  rule 3  `jobs.<id>.steps[*].shell`, `jobs.<id>.defaults.run.shell`, and the
          workflow-level `defaults.run.shell`.

One boundary is worth stating because it is a scope this gate does NOT cover:
a composite action (`action.yml`) has its own `runs.steps[*]` carrying `shell:`
and `continue-on-error:`. This gate's subject is `.github/workflows/*.yml`, and
this repository ships no composite action. A repository that adds one is adding
a surface these three rules do not read -- extend the sweep then, rather than
assuming it is covered.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO -- READ THIS BEFORE "COMPLETING" IT.

There is no closed step inventory here. This gate will never assert "the chart
job has exactly these N steps", "the workflows declare exactly these job
names", or "these are all the env keys". That pin is tempting because it looks
thorough, and it is precisely the failure mode this gate was written to avoid:
an exhaustive-inventory assertion breaks on every legitimate addition, so it
burns a release cycle per discovery, teaches whoever hits it to update the pin
rather than think about the change, and converts a security control into a
chore. A validator in the sibling platform lane pinned a pristine object shape
and spent six releases, six owner merges and six cluster slots learning -- one
per cycle -- that Flux writes ownership labels, Calico writes pod annotations,
and the Deployment controller writes `pod-template-hash`. Every one of those
refusals was individually correct and collectively a waste.

So: pin BEHAVIOUR, not inventory. Refuse a specific dangerous construct;
never assert that the complete set of anything is exactly X, when normal
evolution extends it. Adding a step, a job, or an env key must need no edit
here. If you are about to add an inventory assertion to this file, add a rule
that refuses a construct instead -- and give it a lift path.

The one thing this file DOES enumerate is derived, not maintained: the
required-checks set comes from `EXPECTED_MAIN_JOBS` and `EXPECTED_CODEQL_JOBS`
in `release_contract.py`, which the release contract already keeps exact
because the publisher authorizes against them. Reading them here adds no
second copy to keep in sync.

LIFTING IT, AND THE ONE CLASS THAT DOES NOT LIFT. There are two kinds of red
here and they have different remedies. Saying otherwise -- as an earlier
revision of this docstring and of the allowlist header both did -- sends
whoever hits the second kind to a file that will not help them.

A RULE refusal lifts through `scripts/ci/workflow-integrity-allowlist.txt`:
one line, one written reason, one PR. Every rule prints the exact line to
paste. Steps are located by NAME, not index, so an entry survives a step being
inserted above it. Four subjects address the positions no step name can:
`<defaults.run.shell>` and `<job>/<defaults.run.shell>` for rule 3's two
default-shell positions, and `<workflow.env>/<KEY>`, `<job>/<job.env>/<KEY>`
and `<job>/<container.env>/<KEY>` for rule 2's three non-step scopes.

A READER refusal does NOT lift, by design, and prints no lift line. It is
raised while resolving the file, before any rule consults the allowlist -- and
that ordering is the correct behaviour rather than an accident of structure.
An allowlist entry waives a RULE's verdict about a value this reader resolved;
when nothing resolved there is no verdict to waive, and silencing a construct
nobody can say the meaning of is exactly the silent pass this reader was
inverted to remove. It would also have to name its subject by line or by raw
text, since the resolved subject is precisely what is missing -- the brittle
inventory pin this file refuses to become. The remedies are, in order: write
the construct in block style, or the value in a spelling this reader resolves
(quoting a scalar usually does it -- `shell: "bash -e {0}"` resolves and lifts,
while the same value unquoted is refused); and, when a construct is genuinely
needed and genuinely unresolvable, widen `resolve_scalar`'s recognised set in
one reviewed edit HERE, which this suite then gates like any other change.
`test_a_reader_refusal_is_not_liftable_by_the_allowlist` pins both directions,
so this paragraph cannot drift away from the code again.

PARSING. `python3 -I` runs isolated with no site-packages, so there is no
`yaml` module; `dependabot_contract.py`'s parser is deliberately conservative
and refuses comments, which every workflow here has. This file therefore
carries a small structural reader that understands exactly what these rules
need: indentation, block scalars, and comments. It fails CLOSED -- anything it
cannot resolve, structure or value, fails the suite rather than passing
quietly, which is the only safe direction for a reader a gate depends on. The
next section is that boundary, and it is the most important part of this file.

THE READER'S BOUNDARY -- the part that bites, so do not re-derive it by hand.
A reader that SKIPS what it does not understand is worse than no reader: the
skipped construct is invisible to every rule, so the gate reports green on
precisely the thing it exists to refuse, while looking strict to a reviewer.

THE DEFAULT IS THE DEFECT, AND IT IS INVERTED HERE. Three successive 0.1.49
reviews each found "another valid form evades the reader", and each repair
that ADDED a form was overtaken by the next one:

  round 1 -- a step written `- {name: x}` was skipped as unparseable;
  round 2 -- six step SHAPES (a bare `-`, a sequence level with its own
             `steps:` key, a wider gap after the dash, ...) located no step;
  round 3 -- four `continue-on-error` VALUE forms -- the scalar on the next
             line, and `!!bool true`, at job and step level -- resolved to
             text that simply was not `true`, so the rule returned without
             refusing. Every one passed `actionlint` at rc=0.

That sequence does not end by enumerating forms, because a hand-rolled YAML
subset that recognises the spellings somebody thought of and treats everything
else as "not a match" leaks BY CONSTRUCTION. This repository cannot take a
PyYAML dependency (`python3 -I` runs with no site-packages, and requirement 9
keeps the Go module stdlib-only for the same reason), so the answer is not a
real parser -- it is fail-closed resolution:

  **the reader resolves a small, explicit set of forms, and REFUSES
  everything else, in every position a rule reads.**

Refusing is not a fallback here; it is the default, and recognition is the
exception. The test of whether that holds: a brand-new exotic-but-valid way of
writing `true` must turn the gate RED with no edit to this file.
`test_an_unrecognised_way_of_writing_true_is_refused` is that test, and
`UNRECOGNISED_TRUE_SPELLINGS` is a table of twelve rows none of which has a
branch anywhere in this module.

WHAT THE READER RESOLVES -- structure. Differential-tested against a real YAML
parser; `test_the_reader_resolves_every_step_shape_a_real_parser_accepts` is
the executable copy, so extending one means extending the other:

  - `- name: x` -- the canonical item, and the only shape this repository
    actually writes today.
  - `-` alone with the step's keys on the following lines, at any deeper
    indent. Valid YAML, `actionlint` rc=0, and the runner executes it.
  - a sequence indented LEVEL with its own `steps:` key rather than deeper.
    This is the more common style in the wild; that no workflow here uses it
    is a habit, not a boundary.
  - a wider gap after the dash (`-   name: x`): the step's property column is
    derived from where its first key actually sits, never a fixed `+ 2`.
  - a comment between the dash and the first key.
  - quoted keys (`"name": x`).
  - block scalars in every spelling (`|`, `>`, `|-`, `|2`, `|2-`): their
    bodies are skipped whole, so shell text that merely LOOKS like `shell:` or
    `env:` is never mistaken for structure.

WHAT THE READER RESOLVES -- values, which is the narrower and stricter half.
`resolve_scalar` accepts exactly three spellings and `resolve_boolean` narrows
that further:

  - nothing at all on the key's line AND nothing nested under it: YAML null.
    (Nothing on the line WITH something nested under it is refused -- that is
    round 3's evasion, and the two cases are indistinguishable to a reader
    that only looks at the same line.)
  - `'text'` with no `''` escape, and `"text"` with no backslash escape; the
    quotes are stripped, the way a real parser strips them.
  - a plain scalar of `[A-Za-z0-9_][A-Za-z0-9_./+-]*`, which cannot begin with
    a YAML indicator and cannot contain a tag, a flow marker, or a `${{ }}`.
  - for `continue-on-error` only: that resolved text must then be `true` or
    `false` in any casing. `yes`, `on`, `1`, `!!str true` and a folded scalar
    are REFUSED rather than compared, even though `actionlint` rejects some of
    them -- a fail-closed reader that depends on another tool catching what it
    waves through is not fail-closed.

Rule 1 is therefore TOTAL: every input either raises or resolves to one of two
booleans, so there is no third outcome for a spelling to hide in.

REFUSED, LOUDLY, with a message naming the construct (see
`_refuse_unresolvable`): flow mappings and flow sequences in any position a
rule depends on (`- {name: x}`, `steps: [...]`, `env: {...}`), YAML anchors,
aliases and tags, merge keys (`<<:`), explicit keys (`? k` / `: v`), a row in
an `env:` or `container:` mapping this reader cannot name, a job that declares
`steps:` and resolves none, and multi-document files. Each raises rather than
returning a partial answer -- a partial answer is the silent pass. None of
these appears in any workflow here, and GitHub Actions accepts block style
everywhere, so the refusal costs nothing and closes the whole class at once.

ONE SHORTHAND IS RECOGNISED RATHER THAN REFUSED, and the reason is the one
above about lifting: `container:` takes a scalar image reference
(`ubuntu:24.04`) or an expression naming one, neither of which can carry a
mapping and therefore neither of which can hide an `env:`. Refusing them would
be a false red with NO lift path, so they are matched positively
(`IMAGE_REFERENCE`, `EXPRESSION`) and anything else on that line is refused.
Where a reader refusal is un-liftable, the boundary has to be drawn with more
care than "anything unfamiliar", not less.

THE ONE VALUE DELIBERATELY OUTSIDE THAT BOUNDARY is a step's `name:`, which is
free text (`Test hostile contract suites (release, dependabot)`) and is not
compared by any rule -- it is only the allowlist SUBJECT. Mis-resolving a name
fails closed on its own: the `<where>` an entry names then does not match, so
the refusal stands rather than being lifted.
