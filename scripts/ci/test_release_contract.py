# --- Normalized workflow parsing -------------------------------------------
#
# Issue #69 follow-up. The publisher-order contract first asserted over raw
# indented workflow text, and two spellings defeat that. Both were reproduced
# live against the complete suite before this hardening landed:
#
#  1. HEADINGS ARE NOT SIDE EFFECTS. Pinning the canonical step names and
#     their relative order says nothing about what any OTHER step does, so a
#     step named anything at all could run `cosign sign` over the resolved
#     digest before the vulnerability gate while every heading assertion
#     stayed green -- issue #69's exact failure mode, restored under a new
#     name.
#  2. KEYS ARE NOT THEIR SPELLING. YAML permits whitespace and quoting
#     between a key and its colon, so `if :`, `"if":`, and `'if' :` are the
#     same live conditional to the Actions runner while defeating an
#     `^        if:` regex. An ABSENCE assertion written against raw text
#     therefore fails OPEN -- the dangerous direction. (A PRESENCE assertion
#     written the same way fails closed, which is why the `tags:`/`sbom:`
#     regexes nearby are safe as written.)
#
# Every key-based and position-based publisher assertion normalizes through
# these helpers, so the contract binds step objects and executable run-block
# content rather than source spelling. Stdlib only by design: the gate runs
# `python3 -I -B`, which cannot import PyYAML.

    shown the shape the fix takes, delegating instead of copying. Two of those

    * an empty body was returned as `"\\n"` by the pr-gate copies, handing bash
      an empty script that every assertion then passed vacuously. It now
      raises.

    `fold=True` reads a `run: >-` folded scalar and joins with spaces, which is
    YAML's own folding and the one genuinely distinct output contract of the

    The token pins above make the App-provisioning paragraph un-deletable and

    the prose is still there. This proves the prose is still TRUE, from the
    same evidence the paragraph tells its reader to check: tagger identity,
    message form, and descent from the single commit that introduced the
    `immutable_settings` job. Nothing here calls an API or trusts a relay.

    It needs the repository's tags, which the gate's `security` job has
    (`fetch-depth: 0`). It FAILS rather than skips without them, on purpose: a
    check that quietly steps aside when its evidence is missing is exactly the

    ``NoArtifactWiringTests`` only pins substrings of this step's source; it
    never runs the ~110 lines of bash that decide whether a release happens.
    This class extracts the real step body from the real workflow file and
    runs it under real bash, real git (against a synthetic repository this
    class builds), real jq, real unzip, and the real ``release_contract.py``
    copied verbatim into that repository -- following the
    ``ExistingImageShellPathTests`` / ``MainAndCodeQLAuthorizationShellPathTests``
    house style. Only ``gh``, ``curl``, and ``python3`` are stubbed: ``gh``
    and ``curl`` because they are the two real network calls the step makes,
    and ``python3`` only to redirect to this interpreter (it still runs the
    genuine ``release_contract.py``).

    A note on the case statement's ``*)`` arm ("DENY: unknown transition
    class"): the line immediately before it,
    ``test "${rederived_class}" = "${claimed_class}"``, already denies (fails
    closed, silently, via ``set -e``) for ANY ``claimed_class`` the real
    ``classify_transition`` cannot itself emit -- and that function only ever
    returns ``"artifact"`` or ``"no-artifact"``. So a foreign claimed class
    is caught one line before the printed catch-all message can run;
    ``test_foreign_verdict_class_denies_before_reaching_the_catchall`` proves
    the fail-closed *behavior* and documents this reachability limit rather

        """Issue #110: swapping the cumulative proof's base must go red.

        ``--base "${anchor}"`` versus ``--base "${boundary_sha}"`` is the
        entire difference between the shipped design and the one the prose
        keeps drifting back to, and until now the swap SURVIVED the whole
        suite. It survived because every other fixture here has anchor ==
        boundary_sha: their release push is a single bump commit, so the
        advance walk has nothing to step over and both arguments name the
        same commit. Only a rebase release with TRAILING artifact commits
        separates them.

        History, all first-parent:

            [0.1.9 base] -> [bump 0.1.10] -> [code] -> [docs]
                             \\____ one rebase-merged release push ____/

        The publisher tags the push HEAD, so ``code`` is both the tagged
        release commit and the last successfully gated main head. The
        advance walk must therefore land the anchor on ``code``; the
        recovered boundary stays at ``bump``. Classifying ``bump..docs``
        sees ``code``'s artifact change with no version bump and DENIES --
        a false denial of a perfectly good documentation merge -- while
        ``code..docs`` is documentation-only, which is the truth.

        The isolation this test needs is structural, not argued: the mutant
        block differs from the shipped block in exactly one argument, and
        the shipped run's exit 0 proves every preceding guard already
        passed on this same fixture. So the mutant's red can come from
        nothing else.

    digest, and report a false `burned` on every idempotent re-run.

    The blocks are lifted verbatim from release-publisher.yml and executed in
    sequence against one sandbox, so the working-tree hand-off between steps
    is real rather than modelled. `helm`, `curl`, `jq`, and `cosign` are

          satisfy this pin. Restating the wording anywhere else in the

        ceremony's canonical shapes resurface in any governance document.

        Round 2 (issue #198) proved the window itself was the hole: a
        competing Ready authority placed OUTSIDE the pinned section — a
        displaced paragraph, a second runbook paragraph, or the Merge
        readiness bullet rewritten — survived. Therefore every block in the
        three governance documents that speaks the word "ready" (word
        boundary, case-insensitive; `/readyz` and "readiness" do not match)
        must hash-match one enumerated pin below, and every pin must still
        be present, so an unenumerated Ready statement anywhere is red and a
        vanished pinned region is red. Editing a ready-bearing block is a
        conscious change: recompute its normalized SHA-256 here in the same
        commit. Honest limit, stated for the reviewer: the closure keys on
        the word "ready", so a contradiction that avoids the word evades
        this net — the canonical-rule equality above and adversarial review
        remain the outer layers.

        Three properties, and the middle one is the sharp one:

        1. The substitution reads `steps.image.outputs.digest` -- the value the
           HIGH/CRITICAL gate, `cosign sign`, and the provenance attestation
           already accepted -- and runs AFTER all three.
        2. It runs BEFORE every `helm package`, exactly once, so the
           classifier's reproducibility re-package and the publish step's
           archive are the same bytes. A substitution moved into the publish
           step alone misclassifies every idempotent re-run as `burned`.
        3. Each packaging step re-reads what IT produced, so a substitution
           that became a no-op fails the run instead of publishing a chart no
           registry can resolve.

        Asserted over NORMALIZED step objects and executable run-block content
        for the same reason the gate-order pin above is: a `#` line is never
        executed, and this step's own comment names both subcommands and
        `helm package`. Counting raw occurrences would let prose satisfy --
        or break -- a side-effect property.
