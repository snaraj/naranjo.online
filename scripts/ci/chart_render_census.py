"""Whole-render NetworkPolicy census for the Helm chart (issue #86).

WHY THIS EXISTS. `scripts/ci/chart-egress-pin.sh`'s text pin recognises a YAML
document only by a raw line whose prefix is exactly `kind` and a raw line
exactly equal to `spec:`. That pin is STILL LIVE and still gating every pull
request -- this census SUPPLEMENTS it as assertions (c), (d) and (g) rather
than replacing assertions (a), (b) and (f), and the shell script's own header
says so. YAML permits whitespace before a mapping key's
colon, permits the key to be quoted, and permits escapes inside a
double-quoted key, so a SECOND `NetworkPolicy` in the very same rendered
file could spell itself `kind :` / `spec :` and be invisible to that census
and to every one of its self-mutations -- while parsing, under a real YAML
implementation, as an empty-selector `policyTypes: [Egress]` policy with one
empty egress rule. Kubernetes NetworkPolicy allowances are ADDITIVE, so that
second document hands every Pod unrestricted outbound access while the first
one still reads "default deny". The independent security review of PR #80
reproduced exactly that at the merged head; issue #86 carries its minimum
fix, implemented here.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES. It reads the COMPLETE installable Helm render -- every
template file, CRDs included, not one `--show-only` extract -- through a real
document reader that resolves keys to their canonical spelling before any
matching happens, flattens list wrappers so nothing can hide inside one, and
then requires the whole render to contain EXACTLY ONE NetworkPolicy whose
object equals an expectation this gate states itself. Nothing about the
expectation is read back out of the template under test: an expectation
derived from the thing it checks passes for anything that thing renders.

WHERE THE EXPECTED FACTS COME FROM.

- The deny itself (`policyTypes` including `Egress`, `egress: []`) and the
  document inventory are CONSTANTS in this file. "No outbound connection,
  ever" is not configuration.
- The workload selector's two facts are the chart name (`chart/Chart.yaml`
  metadata) and the release name/namespace this gate renders with (passed in
  on the command line).
- The ingress peer identity and service port come from `chart/values.yaml`,
  the deployment-provider binding point AGENTS.md designates -- the same
  source `chart-ingress-pin.sh` uses, and the reason no provider name
  appears anywhere in this file.

WHY THE READER IS WRITTEN HERE. Requirement 1 and requirement 9 keep this
repository free of third-party runtime and toolchain dependencies; CI runs
no unpinned interpreter package, so PyYAML and yq are both unavailable. This
module therefore implements the reader, in the same spirit as
`scripts/ci/dependabot_contract.py`, but over the wider YAML subset a Helm
render actually uses: comments, flow collections, quoted keys and scalars,
and block scalars.

FAIL-CLOSED IS THE STRUCTURAL DESIGN GOAL. This reader does not implement all
of YAML, and it does not try to: the goal every rule below serves is that it
REFUSE rather than misread. Every construct it does not fully understand is
refused with the offending line named, never guessed at, so an unreadable
render is a red gate rather than a quiet pass. That is the design goal, not a
proof -- what is PROVEN is the bounded, re-runnable differential claim stated
after the list, over a corpus six rounds of independent review and the
post-merge audit for issue #98 have extended. Refused outright:

- tabs, carriage returns, other C0 control characters, DEL, the C1 control
  characters U+0080-U+009F (a real YAML reader rejects the whole stream for
  one; the range STOPS at U+009F, so `©`, `é`, CJK and emoji all read
  normally), every YAML-reader-forbidden code point U+D800-U+DFFF and
  U+FFFE-U+FFFF (all 2,050 of them, including malformed UTF-8 preserved by
  Python's stdin `surrogateescape`), byte-order marks (U+FEFF, anywhere in
  the stream -- invisible, and readers disagree about whether a leading one
  belongs to the next token), and `%` directives;
- the Unicode line breaks NEL (U+0085), LINE SEPARATOR (U+2028) and
  PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR (U+2029), anywhere in the stream: a real YAML reader
  BREAKS THE LINE at each of them, so a stream carrying one has a different
  number of lines there than here. `\\N`, `\\L` and `\\P` inside a
  double-quoted scalar still PRODUCE those characters, exactly as PyYAML
  does -- the refusal is about what the render's own bytes contain;
- anchors (`&`), aliases (`*`), tags (`!`), explicit keys (`?`), and merge
  keys (`<<`) -- each of which lets one document's meaning be assembled
  somewhere else in the stream;
- every other indicator a plain scalar may not open with, in KEY and VALUE
  position alike and from one shared constant (`_INDICATOR_START`), because
  a set kept in two places drifted apart once already;
- duplicate mapping keys, in block and flow style alike, since a later
  duplicate silently replaces the pinned earlier one;
- non-string mapping keys, plain keys carrying a comment (`k #: v` is the
  plain scalar "k" to a real reader, not a mapping entry), and plain keys
  inside a flow mapping whose colon is glued to what follows (`{a:1}` is the
  single scalar `a:1` there, with no value at all);
- flow collections or quoted scalars that do not open and close on one line,
  and multi-line plain scalars -- a value continuing onto the next line, at
  ANY indentation, including the top level where the continuation used to be
  read as a second document instead (see the document-boundary bullet below);
- plain scalars whose meaning differs between YAML 1.1 and 1.2 (`yes`, `no`,
  `on`, `off`, `y`, `n`), sexagesimals (`1:30`, and `1_:0` -- the digit
  groups take underscores too), hex/octal/binary integers, exponent forms
  (`1e3`, `1.0e3`), digit-group underscores (`1_000`), timestamps
  (`2026-08-20`, `2026-08-20T10:30:00Z`), `.inf`/`.nan`, and integers with a
  leading zero;
- the plain scalars `=` and `<<`, YAML 1.1's value key and merge key:
  PyYAML's SAFE loader has no constructor for either tag and REFUSES a
  document that carries one as a VALUE, while reading the same bytes as an
  ordinary string in key position. Refused in BOTH positions here, so this
  reader is never the more permissive of the two;
- plain scalars opening with a block sequence indicator (`- `), which real
  YAML refuses too -- this reader must never be MORE permissive than the
  tools that install the render;
- a document-end marker (`...`) with no document to end, and any content
  after one that is not preceded by a `---` document-start line: `...` ENDS
  a document rather than separating two, and a real YAML reader accepts only
  a directive, a `---`, another `...` or end-of-stream after it;
- a SECOND document that the stream never spelled. A document boundary is
  `---`, `...` or end-of-stream and nothing else, so a top-level node that
  simply stops -- a plain scalar with another line under it, a block sequence
  followed by a mapping key -- is refused rather than closed and reopened. A
  real YAML reader either FOLDS the next line into that node or refuses the
  stream; it never invents a boundary, and neither does this one.

BLOCK SCALARS ARE TRANSCRIBED, NOT PARAPHRASED. `|` and `>` bodies are the
one multi-line construct this reader RESOLVES, because their line semantics
are fully specified and PyYAML 6.0.3 implements them in one readable function
-- so exact agreement is provable and refusal would be over-reach on a
construct every Helm render is entitled to use. `_block_scalar_body` and its
two helpers follow `Scanner.scan_block_scalar`, `scan_block_scalar_breaks`
and `scan_block_scalar_indentation` step for step: the block's indentation is
the WIDEST run of leading whitespace crossed on the way to the first content
line (so a whitespace-only line wider than the body puts the body outside the
block, where the oracle raises and this reader refuses), a line of spaces is
blank only while it fits inside that indentation and is CONTENT past it, and
the folding and chomping tails are the oracle's own. A stream that does not
end in a newline has no final break to chomp, which is why the reader records
whether the trailing newline was there before splitting it away.

WHERE PYTHON'S STRING SEMANTICS ARE NOT YAML'S. YAML whitespace is exactly
SPACE and TAB, and tabs are refused above -- but Python's `str.strip()`,
`.lstrip()`, `.rstrip()` and `.split(None)` are UNICODE-aware and also eat
U+00A0, U+1680, U+2000-U+200A, U+202F, U+205F, U+3000 and the C0 separators,
while `str.splitlines()` additionally breaks lines at \\v, \\f, \\x1c-\\x1e and
U+0085/U+2028/U+2029. Every strip in this module therefore goes through the
ASCII-explicit `_ascii_strip`/`_ascii_rstrip` helpers, every split names its
separator, `str.splitlines()` is never used at all, and every regex spells
its character classes as literal ASCII ranges (`[0-9]`, `[a-fA-F]`) rather
than `\\d`/`\\w`/`\\s` -- which is also PyYAML 6.0.3's own choice, so the
transcribed patterns stay both string-equal AND behaviour-equal to the
oracle's without an `re.ASCII` flag the oracle does not carry. `int()` and
`float()` accept Unicode decimal digits and Unicode whitespace (`int('\\u0665')`
is 5), so every call site is gated behind one of those ASCII-only patterns
first and a fullwidth or Arabic-Indic digit is a plain STRING to both readers.

Floats are the one number form this reader RESOLVES rather than refuses, so
`_FLOAT_RE` is PyYAML's own float-resolver decimal branches transcribed
character for character; `.5` is 0.5 to both readers and `-.5` is the string
"-.5" to both, because the oracle's leading-dot branch carries no sign.

Both directions are checked against PyYAML 6.0.3 -- the oracle, never a
dependency; nothing in this repository imports it -- over a corpus of
Helm-render and hostile shapes. Six rounds of independent review and one
post-merge audit have extended that evidence, and each measured divergence
this file then closed:

- round one (PR #94): `1_000`, the integer 1000 to PyYAML and ACCEPTED as
  the string "1_000" here; and a byte-order mark before a key, stripped by
  PyYAML, so `kind` behind one stopped being the key `kind` here.
- round two (PR #96): YAML 1.1 timestamps -- `2026-08-20`,
  `2026-08-20T10:30:00Z`, `2026-08-20 10:30:00`, `2001-12-14 21:59:43.10 -5`
  and the other forms of PyYAML's own timestamp pattern -- ACCEPTED here as
  strings where PyYAML builds `date`/`datetime` objects; and the plain
  scalar `=`, ACCEPTED here as the string "=" where PyYAML's safe loader
  REFUSES the document, the one measured input in the direction that could
  hide a policy.
- round three (PR #96): signed leading-dot floats (`-.5`, `+.5`), READ AS
  FLOATS here and strings there -- closed by transcribing the oracle's own
  float branches rather than by refusing, so `.5` still resolves on both
  sides; flow-context colon-glued keys (`{a:1}`); NEL/LS/PS and the C1
  controls; and plain keys opening with an indicator (`@foo:`, `` `foo: ``,
  `|foo:`, `>foo:`, `,foo:`) that `_scan_value` already refused. The same
  round's exhaustive fuzz of the number and indicator alphabets found four
  more members and closed them the same way: `<<` in value position,
  underscored sexagesimals (`1_:0`, the integer 60 there), a comment inside
  a plain key (`k #: v`), and plain scalars run past `?`, `[` or `{` inside
  a flow collection.
- round four (PR #96): one root cause with several members -- Python's
  UNICODE string semantics leaking through where YAML defines ASCII-only
  behaviour, described in full under "WHERE PYTHON'S STRING SEMANTICS ARE
  NOT YAML'S" above. `a: \\xa0` was the value None here and the string
  "\\xa0" there; a whole-document `\\xa0` was ZERO documents here and one
  there; `a: |\\xa0` parsed as a block scalar here and raised a ScannerError
  there; `---\\xa0` and `...\\xa0` were document markers here and plain
  scalars there; `a: [1] \\xa0` read on here and raised there. Closed by
  ASCII-explicit strips and splits rather than by refusal, so U+00A0 stays
  part of the scalar exactly as the oracle reads it and mid-token `©`, `é`,
  CJK and emoji keep reading as before. The same round closed the document-end
  marker (`...`), which this reader treated as a benign boundary while PyYAML
  ends the document there: `...` alone was ZERO documents here and a
  ParserError there, and `x: 1` / `...` / `foo: v` was TWO documents here and
  a ParserError there. Closed by refusal, which is agreement in that shape --
  and `a: 1` / `...` / `---` / `b: 2` still reads on both sides.
- round five (PR #96): the two classes rounds one through four could not
  reach, because every alphabet those rounds swept was NEWLINE-FREE and both
  of these are about what happens across a line break.
  First, implicit document boundaries: `documents()` started a new document
  wherever a top-level node happened to end. `a` / `b` was ['a', 'b'] here
  and the ONE folded scalar "a b" there; `-` / `a` was [[None], 'a'] here and
  a ScannerError there; `x` / `kind: v` was ['x', {'kind': 'v'}] here and a
  ScannerError there. That also FALSIFIED this file's standing claim that
  multi-line plain scalars were refused -- the reader was not refusing them,
  it was silently splitting the stream. Closed by refusal (`_read_document`),
  which is agreement wherever the oracle refuses and the designed direction
  wherever it folds; the claim above now states what the code does.
  Second, block-scalar line semantics: `a: >` / `` / `  x` was "x\\n" here and
  "\\nx\\n" there (a leading blank line is content); `a: |` / `  x` / `   `
  was "x\\n" here and "x\\n \\n" there (a whitespace-only line WIDER than the
  block indent is content, not a blank line); `a: >` / `   ` / `  x` was
  accepted here and a ParserError there (the widest leading run SETS the
  indent, so the body falls outside the block). This reader's own
  newline-bearing sweep added a third member: a stream not ending in a
  newline has no final break, so `a: |` / `  x` is "x" there and was "x\\n"
  here. Closed by transcribing `Scanner.scan_block_scalar` and its helpers,
  so the first two and the fourth are exact AGREEMENT and only the third --
  the shape the oracle itself refuses -- is a refusal.
- round six (PR #96): the corpus above measures ZERO divergence at this head,
  re-run over 182,170 inputs. What round six added instead is a KILL BATTERY
  over the clauses rounds four and five introduced -- each `_ascii_*` call
  site, `_document_marker`, `_read_document`, and every clause inside
  `_bs_indentation`, `_bs_breaks`, `_bs_skip_indent`, `_bs_has_more`,
  `_block_scalar_body` and `_line_break_after`, mutated ONE AT A TIME, 84
  mutants, each run against the whole unit suite AND the census gate. 69 die.
  Nine more are killed by the tests round six adds, starting with the one the
  round-five review found itself: dropping `_line_break_after(k)` from
  `_bs_breaks`'s loop survived everything while diverging from the oracle on
  1,100 corpus members, because a final whitespace-only line with no trailing
  newline is the END OF THE STREAM, not a blank line, so keep chomping put
  back a break that was never there (`a: |+` / ` x` / ` ` is "x\\n" to both
  readers and was "x\\n\\n" to the mutant). The remaining SIX are equivalent
  mutants -- identical values AND identical refusal messages over all 182,170
  corpus inputs and 29 targeted probes -- and each is named at its own clause
  below, with the reason it cannot differ, rather than pinned by a test no
  input could fail.

- post-merge audit (issue #98): the bounded corpus did not carry the complete
  character class YAML 1.2.2 excludes from `c-printable`. This reader ACCEPTED
  every raw U+D800-U+DFFF and U+FFFE-U+FFFF in a comment while PyYAML 6.0.3
  rejected the stream before scanning. Production stdin made the gap wider:
  Python's `surrogateescape` preserves a malformed byte such as `80` as
  U+DC80, and the gate read straight through that too. `_check_bytes` now
  refuses the exact 2,050-code-point class before parsing, while U+D7FF,
  U+E000, U+FFFD, U+10000, U+1FFFE, U+1FFFF and U+10FFFF remain readable as
  the spec and oracle require. Exhaustive class, boundary, placement and raw
  stdin tests make that new claim re-runnable rather than inferred.

Every one of those classes is closed. The claim this file makes is therefore
a bounded, re-runnable one rather than a universal quantifier: over that
corpus and the exact YAML-reader-forbidden class there is no input this reader
accepts and reads differently than PyYAML, and none it accepts that PyYAML
refuses. Every divergence that remains runs the other way -- this reader
refusing something PyYAML resolves (`2026_08`, `=` in key position, `--- x`,
a `%YAML` directive reopening a stream after `...`, and a plain scalar folded
across a line break) -- which is the direction that cannot hide a document.

    # instead of from the widest leading whitespace run, and threw leading
    # blank lines away — three separate divergences PR #96's round-five review
    # measured:
    #
    #   `a: >` / `` / `  x`     -> "x\n"  here, "\nx\n" there (leading break lost)

    #                              not a blank line)

# --- What "installable" has to mean -----------------------------------------
#
# THE CLAIM THIS GATE PRINTS IS "N INSTALLABLE OBJECTS". If it counts an
# object Kubernetes will not install, that claim is false in the fatal
# direction, and PR #96's round-five review found the first measured instance:
# a render carrying a multi-line value in a LABEL censused GREEN -- four
# objects, exactly one NetworkPolicy, equal to the pinned expectation -- while
# a real API server REFUSES the NetworkPolicy for it and applies the
# ServiceAccount, Service and Deployment anyway. THE WORKLOAD INSTALLS WITHOUT
# ITS DENY while this gate reports everything fine. Measured against
# Kubernetes v1.36.3, not reasoned about:
#
#     $ kubectl apply -f multiline-label.yaml   # rc=1
#     serviceaccount/naranjo-online created
#     service/naranjo-online created
#     deployment.apps/naranjo-online created
#     The NetworkPolicy "ingress-to-naranjo-online" is invalid:
#       metadata.labels: Invalid value: "first\n\n indented\n \nlast\n": a
#       valid label must be an empty string or consist of alphanumeric
#       characters, '-', '_' or '.', and must start and end with an
#       alphanumeric character
#
# The reason that shape could ride at all is that `metadata.labels` is the one
# part of the pinned policy whose CONTENT the census deliberately does not fix
# -- which is exactly why the round-five block-scalar shadow was written there
# too.
#
# THE RULES BELOW ARE MEASURED, EACH BOUNDARY PROBED FROM BOTH SIDES against
# the same v1.36.3 API server (`kubectl apply --dry-run=server`, and
# `kubectl create --dry-run=server` where `apply`'s own
# last-applied-configuration annotation would have confounded a size limit):
#
#   label VALUE   `` accepted, `a` accepted, `MyValue` accepted, `12345`
#                 accepted, `a_b.c-d` accepted, 63 bytes accepted, 64 bytes
#                 refused, and `-abc`, `abc-`, `.abc`, `-`, `a b`, `a/b`,
#                 `a\nb`, `é` all refused.
#   label KEY     `a` accepted, 63-byte name accepted, 64 refused,
#                 `A_b.c-d` accepted, `example.com/a` accepted, a 253-byte
#                 prefix accepted, 254 refused, and ``, `/a`, `example.com/`,
#                 `a/b/c`, `-a`, `a\nb`, `Example.com/a`, `exa_mple.com/a`
#                 all refused. The prefix is a LOWERCASE DNS subdomain; the
#                 name part is not (uppercase and `_` are legal there).
#   annotations   keys follow the label-key rule exactly (`a/b/c` and a
#                 64-byte name are both refused); values are arbitrary strings
#                 -- `x\ny\n` and a non-ASCII value are both accepted, where
#                 a LABEL refuses each of them, which is what makes
#                 an annotation the right home for a multi-line value -- and
#                 the SUM of every key and value is capped: 262144 bytes
#                 accepted, 262145 refused.
#   metadata.name a lowercase RFC 1123 SUBDOMAIN for NetworkPolicy,
#                 ServiceAccount and Deployment (`a-b.c` accepted, `1abc`
#                 accepted, 253 bytes accepted, 254 refused, `a_b`, `AbC` and
#                 `abc.` refused) and a lowercase RFC 1123 LABEL for Service,
#                 which additionally forbids dots and caps at 63 (`abc` and
#                 `1abc` accepted; `a.b`, `Abc`, `abc-` and 64 bytes refused).
#   selectors     `matchLabels`, a Service's `spec.selector` and a Pod's
#                 `nodeSelector` are validated by the same label key/value
#                 rules, at any depth -- `spec.podSelector.matchLabels`,
#                 `spec.selector` and `spec.template.spec.nodeSelector` each
#                 refused `a\nb` and `a/b/c` on the real server.
#   value TYPES   a label or annotation value that is a YAML number or boolean
#                 is refused by the server before validation even runs ("json:
#                 cannot unmarshal number into Go struct field
#                 ObjectMeta.metadata.labels of type string"), so it is refused
#                 here too.
#
# ONE DELIBERATE, MEASURED OVER-REFUSAL, stated rather than hidden: a label or
# annotation value written as the plain YAML `null` is ACCEPTED by the API
# server, which decodes it into Go's zero string and stores an EMPTY label.
# This gate refuses it. Coercing a value nobody wrote into a value the render
# does not say is exactly the guess every other rule in this file declines to
# make, and refusing is the direction that cannot hide a policy. It is the one
# place the installability check is stricter than the installer, and
# `test_a_null_label_value_is_the_one_deliberate_over_refusal` pins it as such.
#
# WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO, stated rather than left to be discovered:
# it does not validate per-kind SPEC schemas. A Deployment with no
# `spec.selector` is refused by the API server and counted installable here.
# That rule is not a small stable regex -- it is the OpenAPI schema of every
# kind, which a stdlib-only gate cannot carry (requirements 1 and 9) -- and it
# is not in the fatal direction either: a malformed Deployment leaves the deny
# installed and the workload absent, which is the safe half. The one object
# whose absence IS fatal, the NetworkPolicy, has its whole spec pinned against
# a literal expectation a few lines below, so its spec cannot be malformed
# without failing the census outright. Namespace EXISTENCE is likewise out of
# scope: it is a property of the cluster, not of the render.
